# Cybersecurity Attack Classification

This project implements a machine learning-based solution for classifying different types of cybersecurity attacks. The system analyzes network traffic patterns and features to identify potential security threats and classify them into specific attack categories.

## Problem Description

The Cybersecurity Attack Classification system addresses:
- Real-time detection of network attacks
- Classification of attacks into specific categories
- Analysis of network traffic patterns
- Feature extraction from network packets
- Early warning system for potential security breaches

## Features

- Machine Learning-based attack classification
- Support for multiple attack types:
  - DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Brute Force Attacks
  - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
  - Malware Detection
- Real-time traffic analysis
- Feature extraction from network packets
- Model performance metrics and visualization
- Configurable detection thresholds

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Packet size and timing
   - Protocol information
   - Source and destination IPs
   - Port numbers
   - Payload content analysis
   - Connection duration
   - Packet count

2. **Data Normalization**:
   - Feature scaling
   - Missing value handling
   - Outlier detection
   - Feature selection

### Model Architecture

1. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - Input layer for feature vectors
   - Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation
   - Dropout layers for regularization
   - Output layer with softmax activation

2. **Training Process**:
   - Cross-validation
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Early stopping
   - Model checkpointing

### Attack Categories

The system classifies attacks into the following categories:
1. Normal Traffic
2. DDoS Attacks
3. SQL Injection
4. XSS Attacks
5. Brute Force Attempts
6. MITM Attacks
7. Malware Activity
